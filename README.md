This is an example project developed in Unreal Engine 4 to get accostumed to the use of blueprints, editor and code.

It consists on a simple game mode where the player collects dinamically instanced batteries and collects them with the "Q" key.
The batteries then add some power to the player, who must fully charge himself before running out of power.

Finally, some basic GUI elements has been added to explore the binding process between GUI and code classes.
